Notes: 

- Apply darkmode class to body by default, which will include the mixin with all the dark mode colors
- Have the event listener check to see if document.body.classList.contains('darkmode')
- Remove / add class based on result

- Set default dark mode on the website - use mixin for the body w/ current dark mode css
